The facts of the case, as narrated, are that FIR No. 04/2020 under Section 5(2) of the Azad Kashmir Prevention of Corruption Act, 1950 (PCP) read with Section 109 of APC was registered at the Police Station Muzaffarabad on the direction of the High Court through its judgment dated September 17, 2020. Thereafter, the accused persons filed a petition for leave to appeal before this Court, which was decided on November 23, 2022. Following the said decision, the accused sought bail before arrest before the Court of competent jurisdiction, which was confirmed by the Special Judge AntiCorruption, Muzaffarabad, through order dated January 14, 2023. Feeling aggrieved, the petitioners filed a revision petition before the High Court. During the pendency of the revision, the learned counsel for the accused raised an objection that the Ikhtatami (final report) had already been prepared and submitted before the competent Court, and that further proceedings would be an exercise in futility. Relying upon this submission, the High Court dismissed the revision petition through its judgment dated May 27, 2024. The petitioners, thereafter, filed an application before the Director General, Anti-Corruption, on June 6, 2024, seeking verification of the alleged Ikhtatami. Upon inquiry, it was revealed that no final report had been proposed or submitted and that the matter was still under investigation and had not been consigned to record. In light of these disclosures, the petitioners filed a review petition before the High Court challenging the judgment dated May 27, 2024. The High Court, after conducting the necessary proceedings, dismissed the review petition through the impugned judgment dated April 15, 2025.
